# CThreads
Practicing basic mutex functionality of POSIC threads to coordinate non-thread-safe operations in C.

#### Runtime and performance analysis
The following values are generated using BASH's build-in ```time``` (simplified version of /usr/bin/time) with the syntax ```{ time ./task3spin.out;} 2>> times.txt``` (```time``` prints to ```stderr```, which has to be redirected with ```2>>```.).

##### Using ```pthread_mutex```:
Unlike spinlocks, mutexes don't use busy waiting, thus reducing CPU usage, which is especially important for longer waiting periods. Thread execution is stopped temporarily, until the thread is woken up when the mutex is available again. Mutexes are arguably slightly more secure than Spinlocks, which can in some cases enter undefined states.

##### Using ```pthread_spinlock```:
A spinlock has various advantages compared to traditional mutexes. First of, the waiting threads don't enter a sleeping state or have to be woken up by a signal, but instead actively try to enter the code segment. This uses CPU resources, but it is faster in many cases (compare log file below), expecially when mutex sections are small and/or accessed very often (in this case by a ```i = 0 -> i < 100000``` loop in every thread).

##### Using ```pthread_cond_var```:
A conditional variable works similar to a semaphore, in that it allows threads to efficiently coordinate critical section timing and many producer-consumer problems, without relying on spinlocks.

However, it is necessary to use a while-loop as follows:

    while(!RESUME) {
               pthread_cond_wait(&queueCond, &queueMutex);
           }

This is because it is possible that ```pthread_cond_wait``` can experience random "spurious wakeups", which would otherwise lead to the execution being resumed without necessarily ```!RESUME``` being ```true```.
